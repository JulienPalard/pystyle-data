Some stats about Python projects
================================

This is generated using `pystyle
<https://github.com/julienpalard/pystyle/>`_, it still lacks dataviz
and a lot of crawl time, but that's a start point.

Lots of "style metrics" are to be added like:

- licence
- supported Python versions
- PEP8 complience
- test engine used
- last commit
- number of github stars and forks
- number of open issues
- number of commits
